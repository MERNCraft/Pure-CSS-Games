Before you start, you can play a little with the CSS-only activities below. Ask yourself these questions:

- How can I create a countdown timer in CSS?
- How can I calculate a score in CSS?
- How is a counter used for the _letters_ in the word game?
- CSS can do arithmetic?
- Yes, OK, it has `calc()`, but how can I get it to show me the results?
- How do I cycle through all the numbers, using a single button?
- Really!? I can use _counters_ to animate emojis? How soon can I use that in a project?
- How does a counter know where the mouse is?

If you start with questions, each time you find an answer, you get a little buzz of satisfaction. It's like with jokes. If you hear the punchline first, you might think: "When am I ever going to need an answer like this?" If you hear the build-up first, the punchline becomes something you want to share with your friends.

These are not all complete games or puzzles. You can think of them as illustrations of the concepts that you will be reading more about below.

You might also have other questions, like:

- How do I detect when the player has won?
- How do I stop the game when the player's time runs out?
- How do I make an animation glitch?
- How do I ensure that whichever button the player clicks last behaves differently from the others?
- Must I solve the word game to find a link to the repo?
- How do I create that neat revolving reel animation?

Keep these questions in mind. You'll find answers to them in forthcoming tutorials... unless you can create good ~~punchlines~~ answers for yourself first : )
