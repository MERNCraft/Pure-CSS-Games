If you have worked your way through all the explanations and the exercises up to here then you should have a clearer idea about:

1. Using checkboxes and radio buttons to store state
2. Using animations to change state
3. Using `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements
4. Using `z-index` to reorder elements
5. Using the `:hover` pseudo-class to intercept the actions of the mouse
6. Writing selectors that control the logic
7. Using custom CSS properties

Specifically, you should have a deeper understanding about how you can use and abuse CSS `counter`s, `@counter-style`s, `list-style-type` and styling the `::marker` pseudo-element for lists.

You can apply this new knowledge not just to creating CSS-only activities, but to the CSS that you use in any project.

## Thinking outside the box

More importantly, I hope that you have picked up some ideas on how to explore a topic, how to test its limits, how to take it in new directions.

I've suggested that you have fun making mistakes and testing unorthodox approaches. Be sure, though, to test in all the major browsers as you go, so that you do not create something that only works in one browser when the stars are correctly aligned.

I'm hoping that you will be inspired to create some CSS-only activities of your own. If you do, please [send me a link to your creations](https://github.com/MERNCraft/Pure-CSS-Games/issues/new), so that I can learn from you.
