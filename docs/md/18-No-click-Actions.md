So far, you've seen how to count checkboxes, radio buttons and other elements which are displayed on the page. This requires the user to interact physically with your game, and interaction is what gives your players the feeling that they are in control. (But you know that _you_, the game developer, you are _really_ the one who is in control of their experience.)

Often, though, you want certain actions of your game to happen automatically: a countdown timer, for example, or a spinning reel on a fruit machine, or the expression on an emoji face. Or you may want to trigger something without the player performing an action as deliberate as a conscious click.

In the rest of this article, I'll describe two other solutions: CSS animations and the `:hover` pseudo-class.
