<summary>A challenge for you</summary>
This arrangement of three circles, one above the other, might make you think of traffic lights. And you might be tempted now to get distracted and see if you can create a set of interactive traffic light with only CSS. 

And why not? It's fun to play, and play is great for learning.

The sequence of traffic lights is not the same in every country. Here's a CSS-only illustration of the traffic light sequences in France and in the UK.

<iframe
  id="iframe-traffic-lights"
  title="Traffic Lights"
  width="150"
  height="300"
  src="https://merncraft.github.io/traffic-lights/">
</iframe>

If you want to try this yourself, here's a hint: You'll be placing a checkbox `<input>` and a `<span>` inside a `<label>` for each light, as you have just been doing, but the `<span>` inside (at least) one label will need a `z-index` setting, so that a click on this `<span>` will check a radio button in a lower layer.

The GitHub octocat logo in the bottom right corner will take you to the repository where you can see how this CSS-only activity works.

But _this_ article is about **counting** and you won't need to count anything with traffic lights. So when you are ready, perhaps you would like to continue?
